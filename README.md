# Multi-Threaded Background Image Scaler
A Delphi 7 compatible multi-threaded image decoder and scaler based on GDI+

# Demo Application
This demo decodes and scales images in the background as soon as you click the mouse anywhere in the form.

While the images are loaded and scaled, anti-aliased text is drawn against a semi-transparent layered window with rounded rectangle corners.

You can use the keyboard to navigate the list or press space to animate to a random list position every 1000ms.
