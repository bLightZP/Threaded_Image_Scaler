# Multi-Threaded Background Image Scaler
A Delphi 7 compatible multi-threaded image decoder and scaler based on GDI+

# Demo Application
This demo decodes and scales images in the background as soon as you click the mouse anywhere in the form.

While the images are loaded and scaled, anti-aliased text is drawn against a semi-transparent layered window with rounded rectangle corners.

As soon as images are loaded, they are drawn next to the text.

You can use the keyboard to navigate the list or press space to animate to a random list position every 1000ms.

The demo also showcases how to use GDI+ to create a per-pixel semi-transparent window with rounded corners and animated scrolling text.
